Background
==========

This is a TODO list for networking related work.

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.
   The complexity scale is exponential, with complexity 1 being the
   lowest complexity. Complexity is a function of both task 'complexity'
   and task 'scope'.


IPv6
====

- Hop-by-Hop option handling

   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: C1

   Parse IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options and act accordingly.
   See RFC 2460 for details.

- Anycast address support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1

   Add support for Anycast addresses, RFC 3513

- ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1

   Add support for sending "Packet Too Big" error when
   needed. RFC 4443

- ICMPv6 "Parameter Problem" support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C1

   Add support for sending "Parameter Problem" error when
   needed. RFC 4443

- Multicast join/leave support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C2

   Add support for sending joining and leaving multicast group.
   See RFC 3810 and 4604 for details.


IPv4
====

- Multicast join/leave support

   Priority: Low
   Complexity: C2

   Add support for sending joining and leaving multicast group.
   See RFC 3376 and 4604 for details.


TCP
===

- Core TCP support

   Priority: High
   Complexity: C4

   Add core / basic support for receiving and sending TCP
   packets. This means that we should be able to initiate
   the connection (client role) or receive a connection request
   (server role). After the connection establishment, the
   TCP data should be processed so that applications can receive
   it. Application can use the net_context API for connection
   establishment and shutdown, and for sending and receiving data.


L2
==

- Add a interface management API

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C4

  Add a generic API to let upper layers configuring network interfaces
  as well as tweaking its L2 layer and raising dedicated process.
  (I.e.: Running a scan in 802.15.4)



IEEE 802.15.4
=============

2011 version
------------

- CSMA-CA Radio protocol support

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

  Add CSMA-CA radio protocol as a replacement of the current
  too simplistic ALOHA radio protocol.

- Beacon frame support

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C1

  Add the means to parse or create Beacon frames.

- MAC command frame support

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C2

  Add the means to parse or create MAC command frames.
  All commands as stated in table 5.

- Management service: RFD level support

  Priority: High
  Complexity: C4

  Support Management service to align with RFD requirements.
  See Chapter 6.2

- Security support

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C4

  Support security, as detailed in Chapter 7.

- Management service: FFD level support

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C4

  Support Management service to align with FFD requirements.
  See Chapter 6.2


2012-2015 versions
------------------

- IE list support

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

  Support newly added IE list which can be embedded into frames.

- Update existing Management commands

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C4

  Behavioral changes as well as improvements need to be applied
  to existing Management commands.

- TSCH Radio protocol support

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C2

  Add TSCH radio protocol as the latest radio protocol improvement.

- Multipurpose frame support

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

  Add the means to parse or create Multipurpose frames.

- LLDN frame support

  Priority: Low
  Complexity: C2

  Add the means to parse or create LLDN frames.
  Is this needed however, since it requires true RT capabilities?
