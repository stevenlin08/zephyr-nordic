	  Add support for low rate WPAN IEEE 802.15.4 technology.

config  NET_L2_IEEE802154_DEBUG
	bool "Enable IEEE 802.15.4 stack debug messages"
	default n
	help
	  Enable it if you want to see what's happening. Only useful
	  for developers.

config  NET_L2_IEEE802154_ACK_REPLY
	bool "Enable IEEE 802.15.4 ACK reply logic"
	default y
	help
	  Enable inner stack's logic on handling ACK request. Note that
	  if the hw driver has an AUTOACK feature, this is then unnecessary.

config  NET_L2_IEEE802154_RADIO_ALOHA
	bool "Enable IEEE 802.15.4 Aloha radio protocol"
	default y
	help
	  Use Aloha mechanism to transmit packets. This is a simplistic
	  way of transmitting packets and fits contexts where radio spectrum
	  is not too heavily loaded.

config  NET_L2_IEEE802154_RADIO_ALOHA_TX_RETRIES
	int "Transmission attempts"
	default 2
	help
	  Number of transmission attempts radio driver should do, before
	  replying it could not send the packet.

	bool "Support only an OVERLY Reduced Functionality Device"
	default n
	help
	  This is a TEST ONLY support. Do not use that in production! This is
	  not spec compliant. This is added for 2 reasons: to support legacy
	  stack behavior and for testing. PAN ID is fixed as well as the channel.
	  The device is not able to scan, associate to a PAN or anything else
	  like that. You have been warned.

	  The fixed PAN ID to use for the ORFD.
